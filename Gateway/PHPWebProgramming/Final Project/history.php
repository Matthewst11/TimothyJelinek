If you're reading this I know what you're thinking.  How did El Padre's Pizzeria begin?
Great question!  El Padre's Pizzera started as a thought in Saucey's head on Februrary 31st, 2013.  Saucey wanted to be their 
own boss while also serving their communinty.  They thought for hours about what their town needed. Then AHA!  The town needed a pizzeria!
A week later they started at the ground running trying to get their dream going.
